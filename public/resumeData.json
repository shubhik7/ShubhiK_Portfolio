    "bio": "Hi, I'm Shubhi Kulshreshtha, a Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Engineering. I graduated from G.L. Bajaj Group of Institutions in Mathura, where I honed my skills in languages like Python, Java, and C. My expertise in web development spans across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Redux, allowing me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. At Cognizant Technology Solutions, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several critical projects, particularly in the realm of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). My work involved customizing Windchill functionalities, developing frontend components, and integrating REST services into internal applications. I pride myself on my ability to translate business requirements into functional solutions, maintain high coding standards, and ensure seamless user experiences. I’m passionate about solving complex problems through innovative solutions and continuously refining my skills to contribute effectively to the tech community.",
